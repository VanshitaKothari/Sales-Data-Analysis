# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to identify trends, patterns, and key business insights.  
The goal is to understand how data can support decision-making in real-world scenarios.


## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  


## Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Orders  
- Regions  
- Categories  
- Products  
- Sales  


## Analysis Performed
- Sales by Region  
- Sales by Category  
- Monthly Sales Trend  
- Top Performing Products  


## Visualizations

![Monthly Sales Trend](Images/monthly_sales.png)  


## Key Insights
- The "West" region generated the highest sales.  
- The "Technology" category contributed the most revenue.  
- Sales peaked around "November", indicating seasonal trends.  
- A small group of products contributes significantly to total sales.  


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how data analysis can transform raw data into meaningful insights that support business decisions.


## Future Improvements
- Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI  
- Perform deeper analysis using more advanced techniques

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created using Microsoft Power BI to visualize and explore the sales data dynamically.

### Dashboard Features
- KPI Cards for Total Sales and Total Orders  
- Sales by Region (Clustered Bar Chart)  
- Sales by Category  
- Monthly Sales Trend  
- Interactive Slicers for Region and Category  

### Dashboard Files
- `Sales Dashboard.pbix` – Interactive dashboard file  
- `Sales Dashboard.pdf` – Static preview version  

For full interactivity (filters and slicers), please open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
